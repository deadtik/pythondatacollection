If the PDF is empty or the visualization is not being rendered correctly, the issue might be that the savefig() method is being called before the figure is drawn or finalized.
The data is properly visualized and exported to a PDF.
Key Fixes:
PdfPages and savefig Timing:

The pdf.savefig() method is called after the figure is fully created and laid out using plt.tight_layout().
plt.show() vs pdf.savefig():

If saving as a PDF, plt.show() is skipped to avoid interrupting the flow.
If the user chooses not to save, the chart is displayed on the screen.
Steps to Use:
Create the two CSV files as before:
parameters.csv
skills.csv
Example parameters.csv:
`csv
Copy
Edit
Parameter,Value,Grade,Description
Flexibility,35,A,Excellent
Abdominal Strength,13,C,Good
Explosive Strength (Lower Body),1,D,Average
Explosive Strength (Upper Body),4.5,A,Good `

`Example skills.csv:
csv
Copy
Edit
Skill,Grade
Running in Directions,B
Hopping,A
Balancing,A
Turning & Twisting,B
Throwing,A
Jumping & Landing,A
Basketball Dribbling,A
Striking with Plastic Cricket Bat,B
Run the program.
Provide the file paths for parameters.csv and skills.csv when prompted.
Choose whether to save the visualization as a PDF or display it interactively.
Expected Output:
Console Output:
The program will display the parameters and skills in tabular
form.`

3      Turning & Twisting     B
4                Throwing     A
5      Jumping & Landing     A
6     Basketball Dribbling     A
7  Striking with Plastic Cricket Bat     B `
PDF File (if saved):

The bar chart visualization of skills will be saved in the specified PDF file, with each skill mapped to its grade (A=4, B=3, etc.).
Interactive Plot (if not saved):

A horizontal bar chart of the skills and their grades will appear in a Matplotlib window.
Notes:
Ensure the CSV files are in the same directory as the script, or provide the full path.
Use meaningful filenames for the PDF to keep track of the reports.
